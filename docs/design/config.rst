Configuration
===============

- Two ways to pass configurations to DVC tool.
    - Via Environment Variables.
    - Via Configuration FIle.

- Note that ``Configuration File`` has precedence OVER ``Environment Variables``. In other words, if a configuration file is detected by DVC tool, the environment variables will be ignored.
